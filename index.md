## Research Statement

I am always excited to work on open projects in algorithmic bioinformatics. With my experience in developing algorithms and pipelines for handling big datasets, I am capable of developing scalable and intuitive solutions that assist in biological studies. My background involves enhancing storage efficiency for sequence analysis tools and facilitating faster analysis of sequencing data. I am particularly inclined towards studying sequence similarities through k-mer based approaches, error-correction in assembly, and optimizing the performance of bioinformatics tools.

## Bio

I obtained my PhD from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University on August 2023. Before joining Penn State, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I also served as a lecturer in the CSE department at United International University, Bangladesh. During my PhD, I was a recipient of CBIOS Trainee Fellowship.
